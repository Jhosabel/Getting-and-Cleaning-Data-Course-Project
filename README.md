CodeBook.md is a code book which shows and defines the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the given data

run_analysis.R is consists of two parts (1) performs the data preparation and (2) follow the 5 steps required as required by the project:

(a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
(b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
(c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
(d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
(e) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
